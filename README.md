### Trying out some django REST setup
- Implement a custom user model (Account)
- Customize the admin panel
- Implement Token authentication:
    - Token created when account is created
    - Token is given when logging in
    - Nothing happens server-side when logging out (token must be destroyed client-side)
- Implement simple registration and  login endpoints
